This is a bubble sort implementation in Java

HOW TO BUILD:
Run `./build` to compile the source files into class files
Run `./build jar` to generate the jar package from the class files
Run `./build javadoc` to generate the javadoc from the source files
Run `./build clean` to remove the files associated with the javadoc, jar package and binary files

TODO:
Add more sorting algorithms

(Please note that the contructor and main function are only there for testing purposes.  Remove them if you would like to use this as a library.  I'll also remove them as soon as I'm done)
